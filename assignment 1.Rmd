This is an R Markdown document.generated for the *Peer-graded Assignment: Course Project 1*  

## first task  

first task is loading the data, this chunk will first check if the data is downloaded or not and then unzips it.
```{r}
if (!file.exists("activity.csv") )
    {
     dlurl <- 'https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip'  
     download.file(dlurl,destfile='repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip',mode='wb')  
     unzip('repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip')
    }

# Read data
data <- read.csv("activity.csv")
```

We first need to restructure our data in a way that is more suitable to do analysis on, we would need to sum the steps of each day together to make our life a bit easier.
```{r}
num_of_steps = aggregate(steps~date,data,sum) # this puts all the steps of each day together
```

run this to check if it worked  

```{r}
head(num_of_steps)
```

## secound task
